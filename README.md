This script includes functionality for RedM servers which allows players to point similar to how you would in GTA V

## Known Issues
Due to RedM/RDR2 limitations you can't point towards the specific decimal location of the cameras rotation, nor can you point upwards or downwards.
To create a similar effect as to what you see in GTA/FiveM etc.. we use animations and trigger between them depending on some basic math which gets the cameras rotation.
